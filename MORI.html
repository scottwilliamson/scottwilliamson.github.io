        <h2>LE MORIBOND (SEASONS IN THE SUN)</h2>

<p>How would I take it if I knew I was dying now?  This is a question that comes to mind in considering the versions of Jacques Brel's 1961 song, &laquo; Le Moribond &raquo; (the dying one).</p>

<p>Delivered in Brel's speak-singing style against a driving backbeat, the original is frank with traces of anger, almost bitter, as the narrator mandates in each chorus that people laugh, dance and have a great time while he is being put &#8220;in the hole."</p>

<p>He observes that it is hard to die in spring (when life is returning to the Earth) and passes from taking his leave of a dear friend to the parish priest with whom he agreed to disagree, his wife's lover (apparently still in great health) and, finally, his unfaithful wife.</p>

<p>He expects that the first three will take care of his wife--his friend, who is good; the priest, her confidant (who no doubt knew of her infidelity); and her lover.  As for his wife, he expects that she will take care of him when his eyes are closed, since he often closed his eyes to her infidelity.</p>

<p>Given his circumstances, it's hard to argue with the narrator, who at least is honest, free of hypocrisy and brave to face his situation head on.  If the narrator's edge risks being off-putting, it's still a moving portrait of a human being in crisis.</p>

<p>The Kingston Trio's 1964 English language &#8220;Seasons in the Sun" keeps something of a driving chorus but is more musical in the verses.  It retains the theme of the harshness of dying in the spring and makes it clear that the friend in the first verse (keeping his name from the French version, &#8220;Emile") has been his friend since childhood.</p>

<p>The lyrics of the English chorus, instead of issuing the strange command to rejoice at the narrator's burial, express regret that his time with his interlocutor is over, with the famous &#8220;We had joy, we had fun, we had seasons in the sun . . ."</p>

<p>Instead of a priest or vicar whose viewpoint is dismissed, the second verse in English addresses itself to the narrator's father, asking for prayer and acknowledging that the narrator &#8220;was the black sheep of the family" and that his dad tried to teach him right from wrong.  &#8220;Too much wine and too much song," the narrator reflects, promising to be present when his father sees children in future.</p>

<p>Skipping over his wife's lover, the Kingston Trio's final verse goes straight to the narrator's wife (&#8220;Fran&ccedil;oise"), who he trusted and who cheated on him with a friend but whom he forgave in the end, perhaps because she spared him &#8220a lonely life."  He cautions her, though, with her &#8220;lovers everywhere," &#8220;Just be careful: I'll be there."</p>

<p>The pacing of the Kingston Trio's wrap-up is a little mannered and halting.  Overall, this version moves away from Brel's more purely wronged, edgy tone towards one of regret.</p>

<p>Terry Jacks' huge hit 1974 version of &#8220Seasons of the Sun" abandoned Brel's edge altogether for that pure pathos of which the 1970s were not afraid.  No driving backbeat to the chorus, and the final verse about the adulterous wife was discarded in favor of a farewell to &#8220Michelle, my little one," most likely a life partner who offered the narrator pure love and encouragement.  She could be his daughter, but I don't know that it would be his daughter's function to &#8220get his feet back on the ground."</p>

<p>Going for melodrama over edge or mannerism, this version could be accused of being schmalzy.  It hit a chord and was very successful in its day, and as we age and are confronted with the reality of death in our own lives, here's one song that faces the issue head on.</p>
