        <h2>L'AMOUR EST BLEU (LOVE IS BLUE)</h2>

<p>&laquo; L'amour est bleu &raquo; was Luxembourg's 1967 entry in the Eurovision Song Contest and came in 4th, sung forthrightly by singer Vicky (Leandros) against an orchestral backdrop.</p>

<p> Unlike the Anglo sensibility, which associates &#8220;blueness" with sorrow, blue here is a reference to the happiness of calm skies and her love's eyes when he is present, as contrasted with the &#8220;gray" of rainy, depressing skies and his absence.</p>

<p>French orchestra leader Paul Mauriat released an orchestral version of the song with no vocals in 1967/68 that was a huge hit in America, number one for five weeks and making him the only French artist to top the charts in the United States.  His version was a staple of easy listening stations for years.</p>

<p>Vicky Leandros also recorded English lyrics to the song, focusing on the Anglo association of &#8220;blue" with sadness (at her love's absence) and working several other colors into the song (the green of envy and so on).  In this version, the separation between the couple appears to be permanent, instead of intermittent as in the French version.  So the narrator's sadness is ongoing.</p>
