        <h2>WASHINGTON SQUARE (UN AIR DE BANJO)</h2>

<p>&#8220;Washington Square" by the Village Stompers out of New York City was a big instrumental hit in 1963.  It had a significant part for banjo and did not originally include lyrics.</p>

<p>A French version of the song, &laquo; Un air de banjo &raquo;, has appropriately trans-Atlantic lyrics and was popularized by singer Sacha Distel.  In it, a musician who composes on banjo falls asleep over his instrument to the sound of winter rain like music falling on the roof.</p>

<p>In his dreams, the musician's music becomes an increasingly huge success in America, all to win the love of a woman he knows back in the real world.  Painfully, however, the woman happens upon him back in reality and leaves laughing.</p>

<p>The song ends with the musician crying but manages to snatch victory from the clutches of defeat:  Unbeknownst to him, the door is opening:  his love has had second thoughts and is returning.</p>
