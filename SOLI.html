        <h2>SOLITAIRE (SOLITAIRE English version)</h2>

<p>&laquo; Solitaire &raquo; is a French word meaning &#8220;solitary," &#8220;alone" or &#8220;recluse." Foreseeing, peut-&ecirc;tre, the oppressiveness of the imminent 24/7 culture, the original 1981 French version of the song &#8220;Solitaire" as written by Martine Cl&eacute;menceau extols the virtues of being a hermit, perhaps in the mountains where there are no computers (!)</p>

<p>There are also, she suggests, no tenants, no lodgers, no commentary.  You come out of the void, are closer to the gods and die like a giant.  As you do at great altitudes.</p>

<p>Sung with verve and conviction by Cl&eacute;menceau herself and closed with some jammin' horns, the song charted for months in France but, paradoxically, never went very high.</p>

<p>The 1983 English language version starts out with a slightly more subdued instrumentation but then swings for the fences.  The song plays off the stronger connotation for Anglos of &#8220;Solitaire" as a card game played alone.  The narrator describes her loneliness at not being needed, being almost abandoned by her lover and observes that &#8220;all the cards were held by you."</p>

<p>A song of empowerment, though, it turns the tables and gives her lover a change of heart, after she has gotten over him.  She informs him that &#8220;you found out you loved me just a little too late"; it will now be him crying all night and playing Solitaire.</p>

<p>&#8220;Don't wait up 'cuz babe, I won't be there" concludes this Aesop's fable of a song, sung by Laura Branigan with passion rivaling Cl&eacute;menceau's.  It was a top ten hit in America.
