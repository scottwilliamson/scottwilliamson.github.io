        <h2>TUBTHUMPING (TUBTHUMPING French version)</h2>

<p>This infectious hit song from 1997 by British band Chumbawampa features a brief intro (&#8220;We'll be singin' / when we're winnin' ") and moves on to the main event, a sort of bleached punk-looking lead singer singing repeatedly &#8220;I get knocked down, but I get up again.  You're never gonna keep me down."</p>

<p>Apparently, resilience entails ignoring the maxim about not mixing different kinds of liquors, as we learn that he drinks whisky, vodka, lager and cider as he listens to songs that remind him of better times.  Meanwhile, a woman sings sweetly about &#8220;pissing the night away" and &#8220;don't cry for me, next door neighbor."</p>

<p>This is all meant to relate to political consciousness on the band's part, but there is no Understand.  Don't fight it, just embrace the encouraging vibe and roll with it.</p>

<p>Wisely, the French lyricist made no effort to translate &#8220;O, Danny boy."</p>
