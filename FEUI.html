        <h2>LES FEUILLES MORTES (AUTUMN LEAVES)</h2>

<p>&laquo; Les Feuilles Mortes &raquo; (&#8220;Dead Leaves") is a famous 1945 song addressed to a lost love, sung notably by Yves Montand.  The original French version has verses with music, though Montand tends to speak them; below is a version where for once he sings the verses.</p>

<p>In the French, more emotional version, the narrator addresses a former love with whom he may not even have reestablished contact, since he wishes that she would remember the halcyon days of their romance; he analogizes dead leaves blown away by the North Wind to memories and regrets, also lost in the &#8220cold night of oblivion."</p>

<p>Although the narrator fights this funereal tide of forgetting, maintaining that he remembers a song his love taught him and which for him represents their love, the song he sings now finishes on a somber note:  &#8220but life separates those in love, very softly, without making any noise, and the sea erases on the sand the footprints of separated lovers."  So dramatic it's almost comic, and, though set to beautiful music, absolutely tragic.</p>

<p>The English translation 	&#8220Autumn Leaves," sung for example by Jo Stafford, skips the seldom-heard music from the French verses and is mostly set to the tune of the French chorus.  The song is analogously about a love who &#8220went away," but the air of tragic finality is muted by comparison with the French version.</p>

<p>There is a theme of seasons passing; autumn leaves are falling outside the window and the singer seems to associate the love who departed with summertime, mentioning for example sunburned hands and summer kisses; now she sees the approach of winter (paradoxically since the days seem longer, according to one of the lyrics).  But she misses her love the most &#8220when autumn leaves start to fall."</p>
