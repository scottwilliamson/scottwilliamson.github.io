        <h2>CITY OF NEW ORLEANS (SALUT LES AMOUREUX)</h2>

<p>&#8220;City of New Orleans" by Steve Goodman, popularized in a 1972 version sung by Arlo Guthrie, is about a cross country train trip and was a staple of American radio in the 1970s.  It features the memorable lines, &#8220;Good morning America, how are ya?  Don't you know me, I'm your native son" and includes harmonica and high-voiced backup singers.</p>

<p>Although a passing reference to &#8220;freight yards full of old black men" could seem dated or even racist by 21st century standards, the song otherwise is a classic slice of Americana and has become a tribute to a lost era.</p>

<p>A French song set to the same tune and sung by French American singer Joe Dassin, &laquo; Salut les amoreux &raquo;, adopts the harmonica and the high-voiced backup singers but has absolutely nothing to do with the topics in the English version.</p>

<p>Instead, it is a quietly devastating look at the final moments of a couple breaking up forever.  Perhaps they have just finished vacating their shared apartment (&#8220;Come, little one, we have to go, leaving our memories here").</p>

<p>The narrator tries to play it cool, maintain that they are breaking up as they lived, without thinking about tomorrow.  But civilized separations still hurt, and his subsequent words belie him as he predicts the inevitable second guessing each will do, tomorrow maybe or even tonight, about &#8220;this uncompleted novel"; they'll tell themselves all is not lost.</p>

<p> Romeo, Juliet and all the others can sleep in unrivaled peace, however: the love of the narrator and his ex is not a fairy tale.</p>

<p>In a gut-punch of a conclusion that explains the song's title, the narrator offers his ex to leave the building with her (&#8220;We'll go downstairs together if you want") and predicts that the local cafe owner, seeing them go by and oblivious to the eternal parting to which she is a witness, will still call out to them, &#8220;Hey there, lovers!"</p>

<p>One can imagine what that would feel like.</p>
