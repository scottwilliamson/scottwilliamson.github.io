        <h2>THE WINNER TAKES IT ALL (BRAVO, TU AS GAGNE)</h2>

<p>Swedish supergroup ABBA was never afraid to face life's bleaker aspects--see early efforts &#8220;S.O.S." and &#8220;Suzy Hang-around"--but by 1980 and their last huge hit &#8220;The Winner Takes It All," their ESL abilities had passed well beyond &#8220;Honey, honey, how you thrill me" to such phrases as &#8220;The likes of me abide."</p>

<p>In this song, a woman being jilted struggles to keep it civil, even going so far as to apologize if her tension and lost self-confidence make her partner feel bad.  The narrator has a somewhat fatalistic view of life, envisioning, for example, gods with ice-cold minds randomly taking away loved ones.</p>

<p>Many thought it was cruel for band lyricist Bj&ouml;rn Ulvaeus to pen such lyrics for his ex-wife and the mother of his children Agnetha F&auml;ltskog, the lead on this song, to sing.  Only recently has she broken ranks with the wall of denial to confirm that yes, the song did relate to happenings within the band, emotionally if not in every factual detail.</p>

<p>Surprisingly, F&auml;ltskog went on to say that she was good with singing the song, as she could really relate to it.  Music can bring catharsis.</p>

<p>In &laquo; Bravo, tu as gagn&eacute; &raquo;, translation of the song presented by French singer Mireille Mathieu, the winner is no longer the narrator's unseen rival who takes anything she can.  Rather, the winner is the narrator's partner who in abandoning her gives credence to the maxim that the person in the relationship who cares less wields more power.  Interestingly, the three members of ABBA who sang backup on the English version turned out and did the same for Mathieu.</p>

<p>The French version evokes many of the same themes as the English one, the randomness of life, dice, judges deciding one's fate, shaken confidence, questions about the successful rival (here nakedly referred to as &#8220;your accomplice"), and resignation, and adds a left-field reference to the &#8220;cheaters in the big city."  It may not achieve in every line the relentless rhyming that drove the original, but it's a worthy effort at capturing its spirit.</p>
