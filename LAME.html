        <h2>LA MER (BEYOND THE SEA)</h2>

<p>Charles Trenet's 1946 &laquo; La mer &raquo; (written years earlier) is a rapturous observation of the beauty of a seaside vista, complete with ponds, damp reeds, rusty houses and the silver reflection of the light on the water.  His version goes for a big finish that kind of runs against the rest of the song's calm, peaceful vibe, but the song has become a classic of the French chanson tradition and has been used in films and covered countless times.</p>

<p>An English-language version, sung notably by Bobby Darrin in 1959, is called &#8220;Beyond the Sea" and focuses not on the beauty of the landscape but on the fact that the narrator's love is overseas; he sings of the happiness they both will feel when he is able to join her.  His version was also a hit and has a decidedly swing feel to it.</p>
