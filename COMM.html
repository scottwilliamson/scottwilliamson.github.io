        <h2>COMME D'HABITUDE (MY WAY)</h2>

<p>&laquo; Comme d'habitude &raquo; (&#8220;As Usual") is a French song sung notably by Claude Fran&ccedil;ois in 1968.  A man in a very traditional-style marriage gets up on a weekday; his wife fails to wake up or come to breakfast with him, and he has his coffee alone and quietly leaves for work on a cold, gray day.</p>

<p>Returning after work, he finds that his wife has gone out and not troubled to be back for him (this is before the days of constant virtual contact) and he winds up going to sleep alone.  The man appears to care for his wife since he covered her in the morning for fear she would get cold, even as she turned her back to him, and he is reduced to tears by bedtime.</p>

<p>One could hope to be reaching a happy ending, since near the conclusion of the song his wife returns and smiles at him, undressing, and they make love.  But there is a constant theme of artifice which the narrator carries right through to the end after his wife has returned.</p>

<p>Earlier in the song, he seemed to be faking it until he makes it as he bravely soldiered through the day, but at the end when he and his wife are both still described as faking it, one is troubled.  Does she love him after all, or she merely fulfilling her traditional &#8220;wifely duties"?  Would it not be better to live alone than in an ongoing, perpetuated state of make-believe?  Not for me to judge.</p>

<p>The English song set to similar music, &#8220;My Way," is less troubling, even though the narrator announces clearly at the beginning that he is nearing the end of his life.  It is a simple anthem of triumph by a man who, despite life's imperfections, is on the whole satisfied with how things went and who enjoyed a bit of self-determination and gumption.</p>

<p>Despite some plodding rhymes, the English version also builds as it goes and is perhaps less repetitive than the French version, which with its constant invocation of the phrase &#8220;as usual" has a bit of inexorable passivity about it.</p>
