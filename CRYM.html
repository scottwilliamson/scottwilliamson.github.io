        <h2>CRY ME A RIVER (NOIR EST TA COULEUR ; PLEURER DES RIVIERES)</h2>

<p>Julie London gon' make you seriously consider the errors of your ways as she smoulders her way through her 1955 version of &#8220;Cry Me a River."  One of the classic table-turning songs, she addresses a lover whose defenses she has inevitably shattered--it was only a matter of time--and invites him to experience the same misery she experienced when it was her helpless over his indifference.</p>

<p>Even in the grainy clip below, she threatens to set the screen alight as she cooly puts dude in his place.  Do they even make them like that anymore?</p>

<p>Singer Christophe wisely chose not to take London on directly in his own 1983 French adaptation of the song, &laquo; Noir est ta couleur &raquo;.   Keeping the torch vibe, he varies the subject a little and sings of his efforts to inject some colors into his memories of the lover he is addressing and the way their relationship ended.</p>

<p>Ruefully, however, he remembers his lover promising to teach him &#8220;that men cry" and now acknowledges that black is his lover's color; their story was a &laquo; roman noir &raquo; (a thriller).</p>

<p>&laquo; Pleurer des rivi&egrave;res &raquo;, a 1985 French version of the song as sung by Viktor Lazlo (a woman to rival London despite having taken her stage name from a male movie character), hews closer to the themes of the original.  While inviting her lover to cry some rivers, the narrator is actively dismissing in this version, not just inviting you to experience the flip side of the misery that she went through.</p>

<p>&#8220;You played me, you lose" she reports; it's over.  All three versions are seriously torchy, but extra credit to this version for using the literary word &laquo; nagu&egrave;re &raquo; (&#8220;not that long ago.")</p>
