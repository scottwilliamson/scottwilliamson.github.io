        <h2>SUNDOWN (L'AMOUR C'EST COMME L'ETE)</h2>
        
<p>"Sundown" was a big hit for Canadian Gordon Lightfoot in 1974.  It tells about a sexually powerful woman ("getting lost in her loving is your first mistake") "in a room where you do what you don't confess" and issues vague threats either against her or against a rival for her attentions; "you better take care if I find you've been creeping round my back stair."</p>

<p>A French alternative exists set to the same tune, the themes having nothing to do with the English lyrics, versions including by Marie-&Egrave;ve Janvier & Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Breau, also Nana Mouskouri. Called &laquo;L’Amour c’est comme l’été », it begins with an interesting image, "Sleep is good when you're sleeping near me, when you come into my dreams in leaving my arms."  The song continues making a series of assertions about the relationship and likening love to an ocean, a bird, Latin and the wind, among other things.  It finishes by saying that love is like the summer:  we need an autumn to miss it.  Very French.</p>
