        <h2>SUNDOWN (L'AMOUR C'EST COMME L'ETE)</h2>

        
<p>	&#8220;Sundown&#8221; was a big hit for Canadian Gordon Lightfoot in 1974.  It tells about a sexually powerful woman (&#8220;getting lost in her loving is your first mistake") &#8220;in a room where you do what you don't confess" and issues vague threats either against her or against a rival for her attentions; &#8220;you better take care if I find you've been creeping round my back stair."</p>

<p>A French song exists set to the same tune, the themes having nothing to do with the English lyrics; there are versions including by Marie-&Egrave;ve Janvier & Jean-Fran&ccedil;ois Breau, also Nana Mouskouri.</p>

<p> Called &laquo; L'Amour c'est comme l'&eacute;t&eacute; &raquo;, it begins with an interesting image, &#8220;Sleep is good when you're sleeping near me, when in leaving my arms you come into my dreams."  The song continues making a series of assertions about the relationship and likening love to an ocean, a bird, Latin and the wind, among other things.  It finishes by saying that love is like the summer:  we need an autumn to miss it.  Very French.</p>
